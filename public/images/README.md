# Image Assets

This directory should contain the following images:
- project1.png - Main project image (Ryde)
- project2.png - Library Management Platform image
- project3.png - YC Directory image

If you're seeing gray backgrounds, make sure these images exist and are properly formatted.

You can temporarily use placeholder images from services like:
- https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Ryde
- https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Library+Management
- https://placehold.co/600x400?text=YC+Directory
