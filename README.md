## ✨ New Components and Sections

### GlowCard Component
The **GlowCard** component features an animated hover effect that enhances user interaction. When hovered over, the card emits a glowing effect, drawing attention to the content. This component is designed to showcase key features or information in a visually appealing manner.

### TitleHeader Component
The **TitleHeader** component serves as a reusable header for various sections throughout the portfolio. It provides a consistent look and feel, ensuring that each section is clearly defined and visually appealing.

### Experience Section
The **Experience Section** highlights the user's professional journey and skills. It includes animations that engage users as they scroll, providing a dynamic way to present career milestones and achievements.

### Feature Section
The **Feature Section** showcases the main features of the portfolio. Each feature is presented with engaging animations that activate on scroll, making the content more interactive and visually appealing.

### LogoSection
The **LogoSection** displays various logos in a continuous marquee animation. This section utilizes GSAP for smooth transitions and animations, ensuring that the logos flow seamlessly across the screen without interruptions. The use of `useRef` allows for efficient DOM manipulation, enhancing performance.

## 💡 Implementation Details

### 3D Model Integration

The portfolio features a 3D scene in the hero section using:
- GLB models converted to React components using `npx gltfjsx`
- React Three Fiber for declarative 3D rendering
- Responsive positioning based on screen size

### Animation System

The site includes multiple animation types:
- Text cycling animation in the hero headline
- Custom button hover animations
- Transition effects between sections
- GSAP animations for smooth element entrances

### Custom UI Components

- **Button Component**: Features gradient background and animated arrow on hover
- **Hero Section**: Combines animated text with 3D scene integration
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop
- **CountUp Component**: Displays animated numerical statistics

### GSAP and useRef
The project leverages **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform) for advanced animations throughout the portfolio. This library allows for smooth, high-performance animations that enhance user experience. The **useRef** hook is utilized to directly reference DOM elements, enabling precise control over animations and transitions.
